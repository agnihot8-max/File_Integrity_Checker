File Integrity Checker
A command-line Python script designed to monitor a directory for file changes, additions, or deletions. It works by creating a "baseline" snapshot of file hashes and then comparing the current state of the directory against that baseline.

This tool is useful for ensuring that important files have not been altered, corrupted, or tampered with.

Features
Baseline Generation: Creates a baseline.csv file containing the SHA-256 hashes of all files within a specified directory and its subdirectories.

Integrity Verification: Compares the current hashes of files against the saved baseline.

Detailed Reporting: Generates a user-friendly Excel report (integrity_report.xlsx) that lists the status of each file: Unchanged, New, Modified, or Missing.

How to Use
The script operates in two modes: baseline and verify. You must run it from your terminal or command prompt.

Step 1: Generate a Baseline
First, you need to create an initial snapshot of your folder. This baseline will be the "source of truth" against which all future checks are made.

Command: python <script_name>.py --mode baseline --folder /path/to/your/folder

Example: python file_integrity_checker.py --mode baseline --folder "C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\ProjectFiles"

Output: This command will scan the specified folder and create a file named baseline.csv in the same directory where you run the script.

Step 2: Verify File Integrity
After making changes to the folder (or to check if any unintended changes have occurred), run the script in verify mode.

Command: python <script_name>.py --mode verify --folder /path/to/your/folder

Example: python file_integrity_checker.py --mode verify --folder "C:\Users\MyUser\Documents\ProjectFiles"

Output: This command compares the current state of the folder against baseline.csv and generates a report named integrity_report.xlsx.

Inputs and Outputs
Input
Target Folder: Provided via the --folder argument. This is the directory you want to monitor.

baseline.csv: This file is automatically used as input when you run the verify mode. It must exist in the same directory as the script.

Output
baseline.csv: A CSV file generated by the baseline mode with two columns:

file_path: The relative path to the file from the target folder.

hash: The calculated SHA-256 hash of the file.

integrity_report.xlsx: An Excel spreadsheet generated by the verify mode. It contains the following columns:

File Path: The relative path of the file.

Status: The result of the integrity check.

Last Hash: The hash recorded in the baseline.csv. Shows '—' for new files.

Current Hash: The newly calculated hash for the file. Shows '—' for missing files.

Timestamp: The date and time the verification was performed.
